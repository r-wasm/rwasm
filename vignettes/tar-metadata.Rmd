The `rwasm::add_tar_index()` function appends Emscripten filesystem metadata to an (optionally gzip compressed) `.tar` archive.
The resulting output can be directly mounted by webR to the virtual filesystem, making the content of the archive available to the WebAssembly R process.

See the [Mounting filesystem images](mount-fs-image.html) article for more information about mounting filesystem images.

## Filesystem metadata

Virtual filesystem metadata is a JavaScript object, encoded as a JSON string. The format is defined and output by Emscripten's `file_packager` tool and understood by [webR's mounting API](mount-fs-image.html). The metadata object gives the location of each file in the archive to be mounted, and takes the following format:

```javascript
{
  files: {
    filename: string;
    start: number;
    end: number;
  }[],
};
```

## Archive data layout

A `.tar` archive that can be directly mounted by webR includes filesystem metadata as a file named `.vfs-index.json` at the top level of the archive. The `.tar` archive may also include a "metadata hint" at the very end of the file, after the end-of-archive marker. Appending additional hint data is optional, but allows for more efficient mounting of archive contents to the virtual filesystem.

The resulting `.tar` file may be gzip compressed, with file extension `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`.

| Field | Size | Description |
|-|---|-------------|
| 0 | Variable | Standard `.tar` data, including the end-of-archive marker. |
| 1 | 4 bytes | Magic bytes: The string `"webR"`, UTF8 encoded (`0x77656252`). |
| 2 | 4 bytes | Reserved, currently `0x00000000`. |
| 3 | 4 bytes | Offset of `.vfs-index.json`, in units of 512-byte blocks. Signed integer, big endian. |
| 4 | 4 bytes | Length of `.vfs-index.json`, in bytes. Signed integer, big endian. |
